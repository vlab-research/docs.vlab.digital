What happens when someone clicks on your Facebook Page and tries to chat with you? We'll need to define some behavior.

In Fly Surveys, the chatbot will respond with a "default form" which has a special shortcode: `305`. You can create any form with the shortcode of `305` and it will act as the default form for anyone that comes to your page and chats.

You might want to tell people something along the lines of "Sorry, if you saw an ad for a survey, please go back and click on the ad." This helps prevent people from starting your survey who you're not advertising to.

However, you can put any survey you want under the `305` shortcode!
