Custom messages can be created for various error or informational moments in the chatbot. These are useful especially for localisation:


{{< toc >}}

## User sends a message that is not valid

When a user should pick from a multiple select but sends their own answer. Use `label.error.mustSelect`.

## Survey Over

This message is sent to everyone that writes to the chatbot or responds to a question after the survey is off. Use `label.warning.success`.
