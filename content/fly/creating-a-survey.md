title: Creating a Survey

All surveys in Fly are currently created by importing a survey from Typeform.

Surveys can either be written from scratch in Typeform or, alternatively, written in an excel file and uploaded to Typeform using the [Upload Typeform](https://github.com/vlab-research/upload-typeform) tool.

When the surveys are created in Excel, the logic programming is still done in Typeform.

The excel format is especially useful for translations and multilingual surveys, as the logic from one survey (the base language) is automatically copied to all other surveys. This allows you to program and test in one language and, if the excel is properly translated, ensure that the logic is the same in all other languages.
