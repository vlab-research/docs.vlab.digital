The "recruitment" configuration describes how/where recruitment will take place. Every study needs to recruit from somewhere.

There are currently 3 types of recruitments:

1. Simple.


2. Destination Experiment. Use this when you want to create a multi-arm randomized experiment (A/B test on Facebook) where some of your sample is sent to different "destinations".

3. Pipeline Experiment. In this design, we generate an A/B test on Facebook but instead of sending your sample to different destinations, we run the ads at different times (a pipeline experiment design). You can set up how long each arm runs, and how long they are offset from the start of the previous arm.
