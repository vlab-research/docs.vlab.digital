title: Virtual Lab Documentation
---

This is the documentation for using the tools created by Virtual Lab:

1. [**Virtual Lab**]({{< ref vlab >}}): the recruitment optimization tool.
2. [**Fly**]({{< ref fly >}}): a chatbot survey tool optimized for longitudinal surveys and incentive reimbursement.

These two tools are often used together, but can also be used separately.

This documentation is a work in progress. Please feel free to contribute: https://github.com/vlab-research/docs.vlab.digital
