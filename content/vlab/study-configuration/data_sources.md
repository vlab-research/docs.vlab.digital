To know when a respondent is "recruited," Virtual Lab needs to connect to a "data source" which has information about the respondent. This might be, for example, "Fly" or "Qualtrics" if you are running a survey on the Fly or Qualtrics platforms, respectively.

Virtual Lab supports several external platforms as data sources: Fly, Qualtrics, and Typeform.

In order to connect to an external platform and pull data, we need to use API credentials. These are secrets, tokens, or passwords used to pull your data from the other platform.

You must first add these credentials under Connected Accounts, then you can pick the credential you wish to use for each respective data source on this screen.
