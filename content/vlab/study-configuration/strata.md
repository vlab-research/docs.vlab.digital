Variables, defined earlier, are really just a means to an end. We're trying to create "strata" that are used for stratification.

You will need to select the following fields before generating your strata from the defined variables:

- `Finish Question Ref`: this is the variable name, to be defined in Data Extraction, that determines you has finished the survey. We consider a respondent "recruited" if they answer this question.

After you generate the strata, you can manually change the "quota" for each stratum, which is a relative percentage of recruited individuals from that stratum, as well as select which creative you want to use for that strata. All creative are by default selected for each stratum, but if you created different creative for each stratum, you can select those here.
