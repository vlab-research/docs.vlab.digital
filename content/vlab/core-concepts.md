Virtual Lab is built around the concept of a "study".

A study is a project for which you want to recruit people via digital ads. The goal of Virtual Lab is to create and optmize recruitment ads to recruit the best population possible for your study.

To do so, Virtual Lab needs to know a few things:

1. Where should people be directed after clicking on the recruitment ad? This is called a `Destination`.
2. What should the ads look like? This is called `Creative`.
3. How should the ads be targeted to different types of people? This is defined with `Variables` and `Strata`.
4. How much money can be spent on advertising and over what period of time? This is called `Recruitment`.
5. How will Virtual Lab know how many, and what type, of people have been fully recruited? This involves configuring a `Data Source` and defining a set of `Data Extraction` variables used to determine stratification.
